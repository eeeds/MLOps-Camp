## Second Week of the Zoomcamp
## Import Concepts
* ML Experiment: the process of building an ML model.
* Experiment run: each trial in an ML experiment.
* Run artifact: any file that is associated with an ML run.
* Experiment metadata : Result of all the runs of an experiment.

## Why is experiment tracking important?
* Reproducibility: if you run the same experiment multiple times, you will get the same results.
* Organization : You can organize your experiments in folders and subfolders.
* Optimization: You can run the same experiment multiple times with different hyperparameters.

## Tracking experiments in spreadsheets
## Why is not enough?
* Error prone
* No standard format
* Visibility and Collaboration
